# Perplexity & Burstiness Checker

This tool measures **perplexity** (how predictable text is) and **burstiness** (variation in sentence length and complexity) to analyze writing style.

- **Low perplexity + low burstiness** → text may appear AI-generated.  
- **Higher variation** → text is likely human-written.  

**DISCLAIMER: This is NOT a plagiarism detector. It only indicates writing patterns and should not be used as proof of AI or human authorship.**

## Usage
1. Input text.
2. Get perplexity and burstiness scores.
3. Interpret results to assess originality or style variation.
